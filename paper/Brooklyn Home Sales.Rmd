## Brooklyn Home Sales

When data is represented it shows very limited correlation. Using a log scale housing sales versus gross square feet are clustered and no striking relationship is observed.

Taking out the sales greater then $100,000 for 1,2, and 3 family homes there is a strong grouping of data but still no meaningful information at first glance.
